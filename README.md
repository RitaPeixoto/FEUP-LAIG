### [TP1 - Scene Graph](TP1)

-  Parser with error description
-  Default cameras, materials and textures applied when none defined to allow scene rendering
-  Thorough error search and report in XML parsing with faulty node identification
-  Warnings on possible user-made mistakes such has no child or primitive in node or texture defined as null instead of clear
-  Cameras save the position where user placed them (when switching between cameras)
-  Reutilization of already defined primitives improving XML readibility and lightweightness
-  Realistic scene
-  Object oriented structure with get and set functions

### [TP2 - Keyframe animations, sprites, 2D/3D surfaces](TP2)
- New primitives (plane, patch and defbarrel) and added animation 
- Integration of keyframe animations, sprites and 2D/3D surfaces
- Scene
- To the scene was added a person that makes the path through the security, placing its belongings in the security mat that pass through the x-ray (sprite animation) and places itself under the security gantry (keyframe animations), facing the gate (defbarrel, plane), having a positive check.  On the floor, it is possible to see some arrows(sprite animation) indicating the direction to follow, and on the wall, there is a flight board (sprite animation) where it's possible to check the state, time, and gate of the flights and also a chinese lamp. The descriptive text (sprite texts) was added in some places and also some flags(patch).
